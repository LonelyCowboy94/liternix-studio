**LITERNIX.CTRL** is a high-performance "Master Console" system engineered specifically for professional video editors and visual alchemists. This is not a standard portfolio; it is a digital workstation that bridges brutalist aesthetics with high-end full-stack engineering.

## 🎨 // DESIGN_PHILOSOPHY

The visual identity is inspired by high-end video editing suites and vintage CRT studio monitors:
- **PALETTE:** Deep Black (`#000000`) with high-vis Neon Green (`#afff00`) accents.
- **TYPEFACE:** A mix of geometric authority and *Trade Winds* typography for ideological contrast.
- **ATMOSPHERE:** Global scanline overlays, blueprint grid systems, and atmospheric glows.
